          <p>How times flying. I went back to China, but I can not forget what happened on my last working day in Ghana.</p>
<p>On the last day, the last three team did their final presentations, including Chamber, GTB and NBSSI Team. The final presentation was very successful, we did a great job and we got a great satisfaction from client, and detailed action plan was created. It means we delivered these results to client, they are not only deliverables, but also they will become a big impact in future. I feel an honest and happy pride!</p>
<p>In the evening, Mr.Hammond and staffs of GTB met Anouk and me in Valley Beach Hotel, they sent us great presents.</p>

<p>We chat for long time, the most unforgettable sentence from clients is “Unbelievable, I thought you (Anouk and me) are working together one year at least!”</p>
<p>Absolutely, our understanding really more than one year already in CSC program Ghana Team V.</p>

          <p>Day 21, that’s counted to the day of my departure from Ghana on 10/30. Three weeks have passed. So fast!</p>
<p>The most long lasting thing from this CSC experience is going the friendships formed. It is indeed a rare opportunity (very well be the once in a lifetime) to have a whole month to be close with a group of people, day-in and day-out. It is a wonderful group of people, and I have a lot of respect for each single one of them.  I am the youngest one in our team, and so many care and help for me, not only in working but also in life… I learnt a lot.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we (Roy, Anouk and me) finished Ghana West Coast Marketing workshop. Mr.Hammond, the president of GTB (Ghana Tourism Board), was the first arrived to SNV (the venue of workshop), he was very serious to this workshop, we were very glad to see that. And Mr.Hammond gave the first speech in workshop, introduced IBM CSC Ghana 5 team to everyone.</p>
<p>There are totally 15 people took part in this workshop, they were from GTB (Ghana Tourism Board), Ricerca e Cooperazione, SNV, Ghana Wildlife Society, Wildlife Division, COSPE and IBM :). Roy is best of the best, he designed the brainstorming process. 12 participators were divided into 3 groups to start phase one discussion, 30 mins later, 12 participators voted for all of the ideas. By the way, the vote was made by Canada flag tabs, that’s very cute. We choose the top three ideas to be target in phase two.<br><img src="/2010/10/23/ghana-day-21/1.jpg"><br>speech<br><img src="/2010/10/23/ghana-day-21/2.jpg"><br>Phase one voting </p>
<p>In phase two, there were 10 concrete problem&amp;topics prepared in advance and rearranged 12 participators into 3 groups, then had in-depth discussions on these 3 top ideas. Finally, we got a lot of ideas in workshop. We will organize them in structure, analysis, give conclusions and recommendations in our final presentation.<br>Really a wonderful day!</p>

          <p>It is in the middle of October now, we have been leaving for GTB(Ghana Tourist Board) around 8:20AM everyday. According to our schedule, we (Anouk and me) did the training of 4 people’s Excel, 2 people’s windows and word, 6 people’s Power Point.</p>
<p>It is a fantastic time when I touch on Michael’s hand (my first student), Michael was very happy when he know the computer can edit words, can do calculation, can surf internet, can chat… can communicate everyone around the world, his eyes was sparking. Today we did Power Point and Excel training for the president and director of GTB, Mr.Hammond, the president of GTB, working in GTB more than 28 years, he has a clear strategy for the future of GTB, and he is smart and fast learner. When I show something of Power Point in computer then he can follow it in his first practice. But in our training of Excel, it change a lot in Excel although the focus of mouse move a little, so sometimes we hold our hands to do practice in together.</p>

<p>Next week, we will complete the computer training in Oct 20, and facilitate GTB to hold a workshop which was created by NGOs and GTB, according to this market plan now, GTB and NGOs need to create a DMO(Destination Management Organisation), the next step was to organise training so that the DMO understood its management role and as a result the “Destination Management Plan for Ghana West Coast? was formulated. Through this initiative the steering committee members were able to interact for the first time and create greater linkages between the private sector and the public sector rather than just a licensing and control relationship. The private sector (the beach resorts) was organised into an association to promote common interests and views and discuss issues and problems. We hope the workshop in Oct.22 can accelerate the Marketing and Product Development Strategy for Ghana West Coast.</p>

          <p>After a long week of work, we were hosted on Saturday to an amazing adventure in Ghana. Another bright and early 7 am start (we’ve determined no one sleeps in here) and a 2 hour bus ride took us to our turn off to the Amansuri Wetlands.  Just another 5 km to go. But unlike the last 2 hours on some pretty good roads, our driver had to navigate a ‘road’ with our bus that should really only be walked, or driven with a 4 wheel drive hummer.  Unbelievably, we made it the Amansuri wetlands.</p>
<p>Our first adventure was to get into small canoes with 4 or 5 per canoe. Ours was wooden, and had several small leaks in it, but we all had a seat., and a scoop that was used throughout the trip to bail out water as we travelled.  Our boat ‘captain’ began moving us through the wetlands with a long stick that he pushed off from the bottom of the river.  We travelled through this marshland, a river of reeds surrounded us, a single pathway of water that had been developed over years of use, much like a well worn path on a mountain trail.  A bird sanctuary, we saw many birds and flowers.  We moved from the wide open space of the river into a narrow channel and a rain forest.  This was my favorite part of the journey, gliding through this mangrove forest.  It was beautiful.  The silence was broke by a canoe coming the other way, filled with a group signing an African song … we past each with high fives, and their singing soon disappeared. Emerging from the forest, the wetland opened up to a wide river.  The long stick was now exchanged for paddles, we took turns helping paddle our canoe.  The trip in the canoe took an hour.  Of course, it was 30 degrees, but some cloud cover and a little rain along the way made it comfortable, I think I’m actually getting used to this humidity here!</p>

<p>Our journey then took us to the village of Nzulezo.  Only reachable by water, and only by canoe for those who lived here, the village is built on stilts and rests entirely above water.   450 people live in this village.  We got out of our canoes and were welcomed by the locals, who walked us down the ‘main street’ and throught the town to the far end of the village.  I have been lucky to have explored some interesting parts of the world, but this moment, at this place, is the most fascinating I have ever seen.  The town was built of wood, alot of bamboo, some rubber plants, extended over the water on stilts.  Small rooms made up the houses of the people here.  We could take pictures of the town, but needed to ask permission to take a picture of the people first. There was a small market, and a one room school house for the kids up to grade 6.  The inhibitants fished and farmed, and everything else they needed must be brought by boat. They had no electricity, a generator provided the only power they had in the village.</p>
<p>We met with the town chief, who explained the history of the village in an African language, that was translated by our guide for us. We then offered any gifts we had for the school children, I had brought several pairs of childrens sandalls with me on the journey that we presented to the chief.  many of us bought a small wood carved canoe to thank them for their hospitality.        </p>
<p>We expored the village, which included a small farm with goats and chickens, built on stilts over the water like the rest of the village. They had 3 churches for this small community. We then headed back in the canoe for our hour long trip back, it was great to get to experience the beauty of the wetlands again one more time.</p>
<p>Our trip ended with some time to hang out at the beach, as the start of the wetlands was located right at the coast. I explored the shore line and collected a few beautuful sea shells.</p>
<p>An amazing day. </p>

          <p>Seven days were pasted, first week ended!!!<br>But for me it was really a rather long time since my arrival. Today is the seventh day since landing in this interesting country. Next two weeks is going to past soon, and I realize that the assignment ends soon.<br>Our hotel is very nice, nice wide prospect opened below us.</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/1.jpg"></p>
<p>Our client is GTB (Ghana Tourist Board), it is located in SIC building. This week we (Anouk and me) went to there in 9:00 everyday, but we realized that we need more time working with client, we will go to GTB in 8:00AM everyday.</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/2.jpg"></p>
<p>GTB (Ghana tourist board) in Takoradi control the whole tourist affair in West Region, they are trying to extend their market urgently to fight for poverty. That’s a really nice idea. we are the first team from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www-146.ibm.com/corporateservicecorps/">IBM CSC program</a> service for GTB. We hopefully help to them very much. </p>
<p>In this week, we (Anouk and me) did interview with most of staffs, 6 people, and two NGO, RC and SNV, they give us so much information. We are getting to know Ghana and GTB deeper and deeper. We will help GTB to organize one workshop tourism marketing and product development strategy for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.ghanawestcoast.com/">Ghana West Coast</a> . It’s really a nice marketing plan for Ghana West Coast  in the future two years. We will help GTB to make this plan to go further.<br>By the way,  Ghana West Coast is the most beautiful beach which I have seen. </p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/3.jpg"><br><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/4.jpg"></p>
<p>And we will also train basic computer knowledge to staffs, including Windows, MS office and using E-mail. It seems so easy for us, but it’s really important for GTB. When we did interview with Samuel, he is the only one person worked in research&amp;statistics department, he used his head and calculator to do research&amp;statistics on clients check-in data of all the hotels in west region for more than 20 years. When we show to him that we use MS Excel to calculate with formula, he was super amazed. We explained it for more than 90 mins what it is, he begin to believe it. I really can’t forget his lovely face.</p>
<p>Anouk and me work here just one month. It’s a small project here, but we hope small project and small project can accumulate a big change.<br>Will.<br>2010.Oct.08. </p>
